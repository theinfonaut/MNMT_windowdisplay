# MNMT Window Display
Creating art for passers-by and neighbors of Monument.

## 
I want the people who walk by our building to be intrigued, and to be aware that this is a place that offers art and events to the public. And for this first display, I wanted it to be more representative of the journey we're on as a house. 

Living with a group of people means that you are constantly being exposed to the unfamiliar. From these single individuals emerge patterns and ways of thinking you might have never seen before. As I was looking for inspiration I was struck by the complex patterns that come from a single line; such as moire patterns and complex geometric line work. The experience of how a group is more than the sum of the individuals is part of the power of banding together. And just like a lot of experiences, moire patterns are hard to describe, you often just had to have been there. Moire patterns also nicely reflect the mix of arts and science in the house at the moment.

We've been working hard to establish our group, finish our home, and decide on our direction. Hopefully beautiful windows will help inspire us, and others, to keep making it happen.
