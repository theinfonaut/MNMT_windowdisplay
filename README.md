# MNMT Window Display
Creating art for passers-by and neighbors of Monument.

## Moire'd Statement
I want the people who walk by our building to be intrigued, and to be aware that this is a place that offers art and events to the public. And for this first display, I wanted it to be more representative of the journey we're on as a house. 

Living with a group provides constant exposure to the unfamiliar. From these single individuals emerge patterns and ways of thinking you might have never seen before. In [moire patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern), complexity emerge from single lines, and like a lot of experiences, moire patterns are hard to describe. You just had to have been there. Moire patterns also nicely reflect the mix of arts and science in the house at the moment. We've been working hard to establish our group, finish our home, and decide on our direction. Hopefully beautiful windows will help inspire us, and others, to keep making it happen. 

It'd be awesome to do this again in the future and create layers in each window, so that the patterns could have a full moire effect. But for now, I'm tying to budget this project to less than 10 hours.
