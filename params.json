And for this first display, I wanted it to be more representative of the journey we're on as a house. \r\n\r\nLiving with a group provides constant exposure to the unfamiliar. From these single individuals emerge patterns and ways of thinking you might have never seen before. In [moire patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern), complexity emerge from single lines, and like a lot of experiences, moire patterns are hard to describe. You just had to have been there. Moire patterns also nicely reflect the mix of arts and science in the house at the moment. We've been working hard to establish our group, finish our home, and decide on our direction. Hopefully beautiful windows will help inspire us, and others, to keep making it happen. \r\n\r\nIt'd be awesome to do this again in the future and create layers in each window, so that the patterns could have a full moire effect. But for now, I'm tying to budget this project to less than 10 hours.\r\n\r\n# The Process\r\n\r\n####Research\r\nI’m always [pining inspiration](https://www.pinterest.com/theinfonaut/monument/) for the house. As I was thinking about the windows, I knew that I wanted to do something with patterns, and I was really struck by moire patterns, as mentioned in the artist statement.\r\n\r\n####Materials and measuring\r\nAs a first run, I wanted this to be inexpensive. Painters plastic is an easy choice, as it’s big and cheap, and fairly hardy. Gaffers tape comes in 1/2 and 1/4 inch widths, which is small enough to do something intricate. I chose 1/2 inch because it would be a fine enough line weight, without double the number of lines needed to cover a surface.\r\n\r\nThere are 9 windows and two doors.\r\n\r\n######Windows\r\n1. 38.5” W x 87” H\r\n2. 44” W x 87” H\r\n3. 44” W x 87” H\r\n4. 50” W 86.4x ” H\r\n5. 50” W 86.4x ” H\r\n6. 50” W 86.4x ” H\r\n7. 50” W 86.4x ” H\r\n8. 53.5” W x 85” H\r\n9. 53.5” W x 85” H”\r\n\r\n######Doors\r\n1. 30” W x 70.5” H\r\n2. (Haven’t measured yet, it’s already nicely covered.)\r\n\r\n####Drawing in sketch (setting up scale, 5 px = .5 inches)\r\nI chose a scale of 1 to 10  after playing with numbers for a bit (5 pixels = half an inch, 12 inches = 120 pixels). I started by drawing the rectangles of the windows, and then deciding on a height that would allow light in above the panels. From there I used inspiration of well known patterns, and made a few of my own. \r\n\r\nI stopped at 4 designs, so that I can test what those look like before creating the rest (ah yes, art MVP).\r\n\r\n\r\n####Setting up the projector\r\nThis was actually the trickiest part. Screen resolution, zoom in Sketch, the zoom of the projector and it’s resolution were more factors than I wanted to calculate. I found a fine grain zoom plugin for Sketch, so I at least had exact control over that. I started by projecting on the wall, and measuring across a shape that I knew the size of, and then adjusting the zoom in Sketch until the projection matched the correct size. My exact zoom is 325% (which actually comes out to about .5inch too small, but I figured it was better to have some wiggle room).\r\n\r\nCustom Zoom Sketch App: http://cl.ly/0C07091e3Y3W\r\n\r\n####To be written:\r\nPlastic is cut into 4s\r\nTaping & shifting (where I get into trouble)\r\nTest hang\r\nNext Steps\r\n\r\n\r\n# What's Monument?\r\nA creative housing and event space located in the SoMa neighborhood of San Francisco, CA.
